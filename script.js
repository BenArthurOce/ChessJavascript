// wishlist
// code that would reject a notation and only accept information
// code that can look up information based on notation
// Should i make a subclass of the dictionary, where it only contains chess openings?

// I've managed to create the actual board positions for each opening. I've essentally removed all need for the logic to even be in there.

// cleaner "init" on other classes (Square, Piece)
// Delete old files
// Interactive Board that creates a board pgn
